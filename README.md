Every large scale project is incomplete without an exhaustive, and efficient documentation.

Getting started: https://github.com/sdslabs/Rubeus/wiki

API documentation: https://blog.sdslabs.co/Rubeus/

## Workflow
Rubeus uses Java-Doc style commenting and uses a combination of Doxygen and Moxygen to gather
all the code documentation into a single markdown file.

### 1. Edit the documentation
Rubeus aims at documenting all:
* classes
* structures
* member variables
* member functions
* constructors
* destructors
* enumerations
* unions
* macros
* variables
* functions
* *.h files
* *.cpp files

### 2. Install Doxygen and a custom Doxygen theme
Install [Doxygen](https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/install.html).

Install the [M.CSS Documentation Doxygen Theme](https://mcss.mosra.cz/doxygen/). Before you go, `Doxyfile` in this directory already has the necessary configurations for a successful build.

### 3. Follow the build steps as provided for installing the theme

### 4. Once reviewed, push your changes, get them merged to `master` and review them at https://blog.sdslabs.co/Rubeus
